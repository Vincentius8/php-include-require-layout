# PHP Include & Require (Phase 1)
Author: John Vincent Pangilinan

This repo demonstrates modular page design using **include** and **require** in PHP.
Each component (header, footer) is placed in separate files and imported into `index.php`.

## Files
- index.php — Main page combining header & footer
- header.php — Navigation bar with Bootstrap
- footer.php — Responsive footer with Bootstrap icons

## Purpose
To understand how to create reusable page components for consistent structure and easier maintenance.
